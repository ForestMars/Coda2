Any Kafka datastream can be used as a real time data source for your feature. This is where you can idntify hetereoskedasticities between your features, which is crucial for holotropic analysis of its [fractal entropy gradient](http://fractalgradient.com) reduction, and distance beween features, which is crucial for time series prediction. Just as we perform Fourier analysis on a waveform to make predictions about what a personâ€™s voice will sound like, or what they might actually be saying, similar Fourier analysis is done on the fractal entropy of each gradient as it is reduced using its Fourier-Garch representation (see [citations](readme.md#Resources).)
